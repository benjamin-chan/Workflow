# Wishlist

These are the features I'm looking for in a project management workflow:

* **Track** project history
* **Undo** infinitely
* **Branch** what-if scenarios (without breaking primary analysis)
* **Sync** local workstation with other computers
* **Share** with collaborators
  * Most important collaborators: past-self and future-self
* **Package** project for a code repository
