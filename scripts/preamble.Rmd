# Wishlist

These are the features I'm looking for in a project management workflow:

* **Track** project history
* **Undo** infinitely
* **Branch** what-if scenarios (without breaking primary analysis)
* **Sync** local workstation with other computers
* **Share** with collaborators
  * Most important collaborators: past-self and future-self
* **Package** project for a code repository


# Git tutorials

There are tons of Git and GitHub tutorials.

* Basic tutorial to get started
  * [Try Git](https://try.github.io/)
  * DataCamp's [Introduction to Git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science)
* These have a data analyst focus.
  * Karl Broman's [tutorial](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial)
  * Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's [tutorial](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/Sta323_Sp16/git.html)
